A "C VM", i.e. a Python implementation of the C language, as an interpreter.
Intended for testing large C codebases without having to compile the whole thing...
Had big plans for e.g. trying out parts of the Linux codebase with a C REPL...
So like, you would be able to provide Python implementations of C functions, and
"link" them, to kind of mock them out, you know?..
